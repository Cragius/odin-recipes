    <h1>Thai Chicken Salad</h1>
    <div><img src="../images/thai-chicken-salad.jpeg" alt="Photo of thai chicken salad"></div>
    <h2>A tangy, sweet and spicy thai salad with vermicelli noodles</h2>
    <p>This is a simple salad with complex flavours.</p>
    <p>While the chicken itself should be flavourful, it is really the dressing that makes it so satisfying, with its balance of sweetness (palm sugar), saltiness (fish sauce), spice (fresh red chillies) and sourness (lime juice), as well as pungent fresh garlic. It is then beatifully finished off with a heap of fresh mint leaves and, optionally, some coriander.</p>
    <p>Note: if making this recipe with fish, skip the marinade and just season the flesh with some salt before cooking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (for two people)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g chicken thighs (or salmon, beef)</li>
        <li>100g rice vermicelli noodles</li>
        <li>1 large carrot</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh mint</li>
    <h4>Marinade</h4>
        <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp crushed lemongrass</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
    <h4>Dressing</h4> 
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>3 tbsp palm sugar (or white sugar)</li>
        <li>3 tbps water</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 long red chili</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut chicken into small strips, as if for a stir-fry, and add to a bowl along with the other marinade ingredients</li>
        <li>Peel the carrot and cucumber and cut into matchsticks.</li>
        <li>Make the dressing:
        <ol>
            <li>If using palm sugar, shave thinly and dissolve into the water in a small bowl by microwaving for 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Finely dice the garlic and chili and add to that same bowl</li>
            <li>Add fish sauce and lime juice</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Preheat a pan on the stove-top on high</li>
        <li>To this, add a little oil, and the marinated chicken, cooking for approximately 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, boil some water, and pour over noodles in a large bowl. To prevent the noodles from sticking together, stir occasionally and, once softened, cut them with kitchen shears</li>
        <li>After a minute or two, drain noodles.</li>
        <li>Time to serve! Put noodles on the bottom of your bowl, with the veggies on top, then the chicken. Top all that with the fresh herbs and then the dressing.</li>
        </ol>
