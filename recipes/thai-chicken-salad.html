    <h2>A tangy, sweet and spicy thai salad with vermicelli noodles</h2>
    <p>This is a simple salad with complex flavours.</p>
    </p>While the chicken itself should be flavourful, it is really the dressing that makes it so satisfying, with its balance of sweetness (palm sugar), saltiness (fish sauce), spice (fresh red chillies) and sourness (lime juice), as well as pungent fresh garlic. It is then beatifully finished off with a heap of fresh mint leaves and, optionally, some coriander.</p>
