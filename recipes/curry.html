    <h1>Japanese Chicken Curry</h1>
    <div><img src="../images/thai-chicken-salad.jpeg" alt="Photo of thai chicken salad"></div>
    <h2>A mild but rich curry that couldn't be simpler to make</h2>
    <p>Though curry dishes are of course most strongly associated with South Asia and South-East Asia, this easy curry is a favourite in Japan. What makes it so easy to make is that the curry sauce itself has essentially been made for you, and is sold is little blocks not unlike stock cubes. All you need to do is give the meat and vegetables a quick fry and simmer, add the curry blocks, and stir! It genuinely feels like cheating, and the result is far more delicious than it has any right to be.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (for two people)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g chicken thighs (or beef)</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 potato</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 box of curry blocks</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Optional extras</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chili powder</li>
        <li>Instant coffee</li>
        <li>Dark chocolate</li>
        <li>Tomato ketchup</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Kecap manis</li>
        <li>Fukujinzuke</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut chicken into small strips, as if for a stir-fry, and add to a bowl along with the other marinade ingredients</li>
        <li>Peel the carrot and cucumber and cut into matchsticks.</li>
        <li>Make the dressing:
        <ol>
            <li>If using palm sugar, shave thinly and dissolve into the water in a small bowl by microwaving for 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Finely dice the garlic and chili and add to that same bowl</li>
            <li>Add fish sauce and lime juice</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Preheat a pan on the stove-top on high</li>
        <li>To this, add a little oil, and the marinated chicken, cooking for approximately 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, boil some water, and pour over noodles in a large bowl. To prevent the noodles from sticking together, stir occasionally and, once softened, cut them with kitchen shears</li>
        <li>After a minute or two, drain noodles.</li>
        <li>Time to serve! Put noodles on the bottom of your bowl, with the veggies on top, then the chicken. Top all that with the fresh herbs and then the dressing.</li>
        </ol>
