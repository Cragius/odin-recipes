# odin-recipes
My recipe project for The Odin Project's Foundations course

This is a test site, containing a few recipes that please me, to practice some basic HTML skills and also the Git workflow in Linux's terminal.

It was begun on 25 February, 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It (the site) is yet to be completed.
